// Below is my current project description

Online Dashboard is an web application to display user fed data in different graphical formats to other users. 
For graphical representation JQuery highcharts has been used. It has excel upload features where users can upload excel sheet data 
by logging in to an admin panel. Which in-turn shows the excel data into graphical format.

It has one admin panel where admin can all register users. With each registration admin receives email and admin has authority to accept
or reject user in the application. Rejected usres will not be able to login

//*****New festures used********//

    Highcharts is a lightweight JQuery chart which accepts data in JSON format and shows data in graphical format it includes all types 
    graphs ex : Line chart, Bar chart, Area Chart, Pie chart, Doughnut Chart, Mixed chart as well as 3D charts.
    
2.) EPPLUS dll for all excel uploads
